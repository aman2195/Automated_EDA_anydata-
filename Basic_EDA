choco <- read.csv('../input/flavors_of_cacao.csv', header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)

choco$Review.Date <- as.character(choco$Review.Date)

### Variables 

The very first thing that you'd want to do in your EDA is checking the dimension of the input dataset and the time of variables.  

```{r}

plot_str(choco)

Ideally, this generates a network graph that's interactive which means, when hovered the variable names zoom in and zoom out.

With that, we can see we've got some Continuous variables and some Categorical variables. 

#introduce(choco) ## Kaggle Docker version mismatch

plot_missing(choco)

### Histogram of Continuous Variables

plot_histogram(choco)


### Perhaps, you are a fan of Density plot

plot_density(choco)

### Colorful Correlation Plot

Correlation plot exposes so much when it comes to modelling - starting from dropping highlighly correlated features to new feature engineering:

plot_correlation(choco, type = 'continuous','Review.Date')

### Time for some Categorical Variables - Barplots!

plot_bar(choco) 

### Boxplots

plot_boxplot(choco, by = "Company.Location") 

### Scatterplot

plot_scatterplot(choco, by = "Broad.Bean.Origin", size = 0.5) 
plot_scatterplot(choco, by = "Broad.Bean.Origin")
